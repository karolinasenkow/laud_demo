		<p> The most recent iteration of the Urinary Microbiome Database was developed during the 2021 Loyola Adventures in Urobiome Data (L.A.U.D) Summer Research Program, hosted by the Loyola Urinary Education and Research Collaborative and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Our team, consisting of undergraduate students and mentors from the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, developed this website over the course of eight weeks as a starting point for future iterations and applications. </p>
